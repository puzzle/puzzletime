DhtmlCalendar is a ...

This software package is developed using the Engines plugin. To find out more about how to use engines in general, go to http://rails-engines.rubyforge.org for general documentation about the Engines mechanism.

== Installation

1. Create your Rails application, set up your databases, grab the Engines plugin and the DhtmlCalendar, and install them.

2. Install the DhtmlCalendar into your vendor/plugins directory

3. Modify your Engines.start call in config/environment.rb

		Engines.start :dhtml_calendar

4. Edit your application.rb file so it looks something like the following:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include CalendarHelper
    end

5. Edit your application_helper.rb file:

    module ApplicationHelper
      include CalendarHelper
		  
    end

6. Perform any configuration you might need. You'll probably want to set these values in environment.rb (before the call to Engines.start):

    module DhtmlCalendar
    end

7. Initialize the database tables. You can either use the engine migrations by calling:

	nothing to do
	
8. The DhtmlCalendar provides a default stylesheet and a small javascript helper file, so you'll probably want to include the former and almost certainly the latter in your application's layout. Add the following lines:

	<%= engine_stylesheet "dhtml_calendar, "calendar-blue" %>
	<%= engine_javascript "dhtml_calendar", "datebocks_engine", "calendar", "lang/calendar-en", "calendar-setup" %>

== Configuration

  the name of the form.
