# Welcome to PuzzleTime

PuzzleTime is an open source time tracking and resource planning web application for SMEs.


## Development

PuzzleTime is a Ruby on Rails application that runs on Ruby >= 2.2.2 and Rails 5.
To get going, after you got a copy of PuzzleTime, issue the following commands in the main
directory:

    bin/setup            # install gem dependencies and setup database (PostgreSQL)
    rake                 # run all the tests
    rails server         # start the rails server

Alternatively you can use the [dockerized development](doc/development/02_docker.md) environment.

A more detailed development documentation in German can be found in [doc/development](doc/development.md). This is where you also find some [Deployment](doc/development/03_deployment.md) instructions
